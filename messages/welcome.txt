Version History
===============

  v1.0.2 - Usability improvements
    - Adjusted the global search URL to the correct one, so that the search shortcut will work.
    - Added support for non-default git branches (brings you to the checked out branch on Sourcegraph.com)
    - Changed the keyboard shortcuts to `Option+S` (search selection) and `Option+A` (open selection) (`Alt` instead of `Option` for Windows and Linux).

  v1.0.1 - Minor bug fixes
    - Fixed a bug where `https` etc. GitHub repo remote URLs would incorrectly build the Sourcegraph.com URL.
    - Windows: Fixed a bug where git commands would create Command Prompt pop-up windows.

  v1.0.0 - Initial Release; basic Open File & Search functionality.
